I have created an Instagram profile page where the main focus was styling of the page as well as its layout. To create a visually apealing design and a functioning responsive page I used different CSS techniques, as well as for it to be functional in different devices.   
## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview


### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: I am not confident to use FlexBox as well Grid but with enough practice I will grasp it as this was the core purpose of the project.
- **Responsive Design**: I have used implemented the media queries, it is working for pictures and expanding the gallery section and the profile section.
- **Styling Elements**: I was able to style the profile, and user information, and gallery section effectively and it does resemble the instagram profile.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: I struggled with properly aligning the images in the grid, and i want to read them again and practise them till I am comfortable with aligning images on a grit.
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: I have achieved the hover effects but I want to explore them more for future purposes to be really confident using them. For focus effects I believe Istill need more practice.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I would like to explore more on the CSS properties and animations for improved stled and properly layed out designed.
- **Code Optimization**: My code is working and have patially achieved the required outcome. But I believe i can improve more.
